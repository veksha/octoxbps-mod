This is OctoXBPS, a powerful XBPS front-end using Qt libs. 
================================================================

THIS IS MODIFICATION.
IMPORTANT NOTICE:
	This is modified version of OctoXBPS and it requires
	"xbps-query-custom" binary file to operate properly.
	Please compile this file first and place it in your
	global bin folder so OctoXBPS-mod can use it:
	
	$ cd xbps-query-custom/xbps-query/
	$ make
	$ cp xbps-query-custom /bin

	--- veksha.
	
Main MOD changes:

	1. added size column (using xbps-query-custom for data supply)
	2. added view menu (all/installed/not installed)
	3. fixed slow populating of data (smart sorting)
	4. fixed RSS url (can be specified in configuration file)


Old readme notes:

You'll need "git" and "qt5" packages in order to get latest dev version!

To download the source code, type:

	$ git clone https://github.com/aarnt/octoxbps
	$ cd octoxbps
	$ qmake-qt5
	$ make

To run it:

	$ bin/octoxbps

You'll also need "curl" and a privilege escalation tool to use it. 
OctoXBPS supports "kdesu" and "gksu" for that.

Enjoy!
